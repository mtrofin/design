# WebAssembly Community Group: Design

This repository contains documents describing the high-level design of
WebAssembly and is part of the 
[WebAssembly Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/webassembly/).

The actual WebAssembly specification is being developed in the
[spec repository](https://github.com/WebAssembly/spec/). High-level design
discussions should continue to be held in the design repository for now so
that the spec work can remain focused.

**Expect the contents to be in flux: everything is still tentative.**

A good starting point is the [high-level design goals](HighLevelGoals.md),
followed by the [FAQ](FAQ.md).

We've mapped out features we expect to ship:
 1. In [the Minimum Viable Product (MVP)](MVP.md);
 2. Closely [after the MVP](PostMVP.md);
 3. In [future versions](FutureFeatures.md).
